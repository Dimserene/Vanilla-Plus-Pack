Custom-made modpacks that are hand-picked and put together by myself

Some mod files needs to be altered to avoid compat issues if you want to put the mods together.（Note that i have applied all the modifications in the modpack)

This is not a full list of 1.0.0 compatible mods, this is a modpack that when put together and my goal is they should function with no problem.(at least i hope)
